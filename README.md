# FIFA 21 Data Cleaning Project

Welcome to the FIFA 21 Data Cleaning Project! This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the FIFA 21 dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring?select=fifa21_raw_data.csv%E2%80%8B) for further analysis and use. The primary goal is to transform the messy and raw dataset into a clean, organized, and usable format that can benefit other projects and analyses.

## Introduction

The FIFA 21 dataset, though rich with information, often requires extensive cleaning and preprocessing before it can be used effectively for analysis or modeling. This project aims to take the raw dataset and perform various data cleaning techniques, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and resolving inconsistencies. The cleaned dataset will be a valuable resource for anyone looking to work with FIFA 21 data.

## Purpose

The main purpose of the FIFA 21 Data Cleaning Project is to make the FIFA 21 dataset as usable as possible for other projects, analyses, and research endeavors. By cleaning and organizing the data, this project aims to provide a solid foundation for researchers, analysts, and enthusiasts who wish to extract meaningful insights, build models, or conduct statistical analyses based on the FIFA 21 dataset.

## Project Tasks

Here's an outline of the project tasks involved in cleaning the FIFA 21 dataset:

1. Data Loading: Import the raw dataset using appropriate tools and libraries.
2. Data Assessment: Examine the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and other data quality issues.
3. Data Cleaning: Apply necessary cleaning techniques, such as imputing missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
4. Data Transformation: Perform any required data transformations, such as feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, and handling outliers.
5. Data Verification: Verify the quality of the cleaned dataset through summary statistics and exploratory analysis.
6. Data Export: Save the cleaned dataset in a structured format (e.g., CSV) for easy sharing and future use.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this project, you should have a solid understanding of data cleaning techniques, data manipulation with Python, and familiarity with libraries like Pandas. Experience with Jupyter Notebook or any other suitable development environment is recommended for interactive data exploration and cleaning.
